            <p>
            With a background in engineering, Diego is very experienced in understanding the root problems and finding efficient solutions to them. As he as learned more about UX and human-centered design, he knew that he wanted to be a part of the actively growing solutions that would make a purposeful impact on users. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After completing some previous coding courses and dabbling with graphic design platforms before Diego wanted to find a balance of the two, so in 2020 Diego transitioned into a career of UX design. He feels UX design is a <b>great intersection of creative and analysis</b> work. There is so much room for creative expression but user experience design focuses on the user and <b>solutions to real human needs.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            Diego has studied UX design through the immersive instruction and complex projects based program with University of Toronto continuing studies UX/UI Bootcamp.
